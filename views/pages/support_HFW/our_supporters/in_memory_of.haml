%p
  Newbyâ€” 78, Born 1931, in Lancashire England, died peacefully at home surrounded by her family on July 22, 2009 in Dartmouth. She was the daughter of Steve and Lily Robinson; survived by her loving sister Mrs. Jean (George)Stewart, Crayford, Kent; Aunt of Elizabeth, David, Alistair, William, Rosemary, Andrew and James, all residents of the United Kingdom. Sheila trained as a nurse at the London Hospital inWhite Chapel, England. In the spring of 1956 Sheila immigrated to Canada sailing from Liverpool on the steamship Saxonia, arriving at Pier 21 in Halifax. She worked at theToronto General Hospital and the T B Sanatorium, Vancouver, BC. Married David E. Ferguson and together they raised a family inVancouver, London, Saskatoon, settling in Nova Scotia. Sheila's greatest joy was being a Mother of Neil Ferguson (predeceased 2004, aged 45), Cathy Ferguson, Dartmouth, Brenda (David) Jacobsen, Darien CT; Craig (Mary) Ferguson, Lunenburg; Linda (Doug) Clapp, Rochester NY. Sheila was an advocate for people suffering from mental illness and volunteered many hours to help others throughout her lifetime. She played Scrabble on the computer and solved crypto quotes found in the daily newspaper. Sheila loved her small supportive group of clergy wives, a good book and a cup of tea; and was a longtime patron of the Woodlawn Public Library. She was a Community member of Northwood Manor in Halifax and spent many happy hours attending classes and met many interesting people. She will be missed by her four grown children and her six grandchildren; Ingrid, Rosemary and Rachael (CT), Henry and David (NY) and Tessa (NS). Sheila's children will remember her laughter; quick wit; love of literature; her "way" with words.

%p
  Sheila was a life long nature and animal lover. She enjoyed living with Cathy's dogs, Cody and Cole, and her sweet cat, Foggy who she rescued at Fishermans' Reserve. Sheila loved visiting Hope for Wildlife and Lawrencetown Beach. She had a big heart for all creatures great and small and always appreciated the Hope for Wildlife center.

  For the love of an old, abused and abandoned Dog:
 
%p
  "Pal", as we named him, was found on our property starving and near death when we took him in on August 18th, 2007.  He was so weak he couldn't take three steps without falling over.  He had our hearts right from the start.   This old guy was never walked, left chained somewhere and didn't have any idea what play was.  He had vocal cord damage and his bark sounded more like a seal going off, probably due to the heavy chain found around his neck.  So began his long recovery.  In the beginning, he wouldn't put his paw on the mat I laid out for him and would squint his eyes if you raised your arms as if he were bracing for a hit.   We started by walking him around the house once since that was all he could muster.  It took several months, and a lot of patience, but Pal's recovery made our hearts sing.  Within six months, he was running with a big grin on his face.  Although Pal was only with us for one year and eight months, his impact on us was great.  He learned that it was safe to lay on his mat, that he could run with such joy and eventually got a vague idea what play meant.  Some people said he was old and not worth saving, but the joy he brought to our lives will remain with us forever.
